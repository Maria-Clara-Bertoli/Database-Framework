# 📚 Java Library for Generating and Executing SQL Scripts in a MySQL Database

This repository contains the implementation of a **library developed in the Java programming language**, capable of connecting to a **MySQL** database and executing or generating SQL scripts for creating a database and tables, while respecting the **existing relationships between them**.

📝 The application was developed using **SOLID principles** and the creational design patterns **Singleton** and **Factory Method**.

💻 The library provides support only for the **execution and generation of SQL scripts in a MySQL database**. However, the **Factory Method** design pattern allows the **extension of the library’s capabilities to other types of relational databases**, without requiring changes to the existing source code.
